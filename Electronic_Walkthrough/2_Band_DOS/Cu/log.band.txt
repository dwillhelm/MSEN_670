|                                                                             |
|      For optimal performance we recommend that you set                      |
|        NPAR = 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      (number of cores/NPAR must be integer)                                 |
|      This setting will greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default NPAR=number of cores might be grossly inefficient          |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing.                                                   |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for hybrid, GW and RPA       |
|      calculations.                                                          |
|                                                                             |

|  ADVICE TO THIS USER RUNNING 'VASP/VAMP'   (HEAR YOUR MASTER'S VOICE ...):  |
|                                                                             |
|      You have a (more or less) 'small supercell' and for smaller cells      |
|      it is recommended  to use the reciprocal-space projection scheme!      |
|      The real space optimization is not  efficient for small cells and it   |
|      is also less accurate ...                                              |
|      Therefore set LREAL=.FALSE. in the  INCAR file                         |
|                                                                             |
